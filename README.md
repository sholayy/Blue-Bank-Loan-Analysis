# Blue-Bank-Loan-Analysis
#### Blue Bank is a bank in USA that has a loan department which is currently understaffed. They supply loans to individuals and don’t have much reporting on how risky these borrowers are.
* Using Python and Tableau, they’d like to see a report of borrowers who may have issues paying back the loan.
* Here is a link to my created dashboard showing loan utilization and type: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sola.agagu/viz/workinprogress2025/BlueBankLoan
